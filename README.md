# Dao Diplomats

Dao Diplomats allows users to manage DAO proposals. It is built using the ElizaOS framework and is designed to be boost productivity of the DAOs.

## The problem Dao Diplomats solves

    1. Voters are overwhelmed by the number of proposals or complexity involved.

    2. Many voters don't understand legal, technical, or economic implications of proposals.

    3. Too many conflicting opinions, especially on forums like Discourse.

    4. Delegates or voters must spend hours reading and evaluating each proposal.

## Challenges I ran into

There were a few issues i ran into mainly,

    1. Eliza's video tutorials on YT and some of the docs are outdated. I had to figure out alot of stuff by myself by going through the code.

    2. The API was much needed by me for this project but it is in alpha and doesn't work as per said in the docs. So, ultimately i had to switch methods at the last moment.

    3. Not an Eliza issue but I wrote a plugin which took data from snapshot's API, but it broke right before recording so, had to do some changes there as well
